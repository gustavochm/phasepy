Phasepy is an open-source scientific python package for fluid phase equilibria computation.
This package facilitates the calculation of liquid-vapor equilibrium, liquid-liquid equilibrium
and liquid-liquid-vapor equilibrium. Equilibrium calculations can be performed with cubic equations
of state with classic or advances mixing rules or with a discontinuous approach using a virial equation
of state for the vapor phase and an activity coefficients model for the liquid phase.

Besides computations, with this package is also possible to fit phase equilibria data, functions to fit quadratic
mix rule, NRTL, Wilson and Redlich Kister parameters, are included.

Phasepy relies on numpy, scipy and cython extension modules, when necessary.
