Welcome to phasepy's documentation!
===================================

What is phasepy?
----------------
Phasepy is an open-source scientific Python package for fluid phase equilibria and interfacial properties computation.
This package facilitates the calculation of vapor-liquid equilibrium, liquid-liquid equilibrium and vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium as well as density profiles and interfacial tension. 
Equilibrium calculations can be performed with a continuous approach by cubic equations of state (EoS) with classic or advanced mixing rules, or with a discontinuous approach using a virial equation of state for the vapor phase and an activity coefficient model (e.g. Dortmund Modified UNIFAC) for the liquid phase. On the other hand, the interfacial description must be done with a continuous model, i.e. cubic EoS.

Phasepy supports fitting of pure component parameters as well as interaction parameters for quadratic mixing rule (QMR) and NRTL, Wilson and Redlich Kister activity coefficient models.

Phasepy relies on NumPy, SciPy and Cython extension modules.

Installation Prerequisites
--------------------------
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- xlrd
- C/C++ Compiler for Cython extension modules


Installation
------------

Get the latest version of phasepy from
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/phasepy/

If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

    $ pip install phasepy

To get the git version, run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/gustavochm/phasepy


Getting Started
---------------

The library is designed to work with absolute temperature in Kelvin, pressure in bar and volume in cm3/mol. In order to create a mixture pure components have to be defined:
	
.. code-block:: python

	>>> from phasepy import component, mixture
	>>> water = component(name = 'water', Tc = 647.13, Pc = 220.55, Zc = 0.229, Vc = 55.948,
	>>>	 w = 0.344861, GC = {'H2O':1})
	>>> ethanol = component(name = 'ethanol', Tc = 514.0, Pc = 61.37, Zc = 0.241, Vc = 168.0,
	>>>	 w = 0.643558, GC = {'CH3':1, 'CH2':1,'OH(P)':1})
	>>> mix = mixture(ethanol, water)

If, for example, we need the bubble point of the of x = 0.5 of ethanol at 320 K, we could use
the Peng Robinson EoS with an advanced mix rule with UNIFAC model:
	
.. code-block:: python

	>>> mix.unifac()
	>>> from phasepy import preos
	>>> eos = pr(mix, 'mhv_unifac')
	>>> from phasepy.equilibrium import bubblePy
	>>> y_guess, P_guess = [0.2,0.8] , 1
	>>> bubblePy(y_guess, P_guess, x = [0.5, 0.5], T = 320, model = eos)

Similarly, liquid-liquid and vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium can be solved, if were the case, with the same object (eos).

For more examples, please have a look at the Jupyter Notebook files
located in the *examples* folder of the sources or
