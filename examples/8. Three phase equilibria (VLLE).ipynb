In an inner loop, the system of equations is solved using multidimensional Newton's method for phase fractions and stability variables and then compositions are updated in an outer loop using accelerated successive substitution (ASS).  Once the algorithm has converged, the stability variable gives information about the phase. If it takes a value of zero the phase is stable and if it is positive the phase is not.  The proposed successive substitution method can be slow, if that is the case the algorithm attempts to minimize Gibbs Free energy of the system.
